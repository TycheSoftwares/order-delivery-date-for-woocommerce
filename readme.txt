Order Delivery Date plugin allows the customers to choose a delivery date on the checkout page. The WooCommerce delivery date will be displayed while viewing the order. The plugin is fully integrated with WooCommerce. 

== Description ==

We believe that the post-purchase customer experience is as important as the acquisition process. That is why we built the [Order Delivery Date plugin](https://www.tychesoftwares.com/store/premium-plugins/order-delivery-date-for-woocommerce-pro-21/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=topprolink&utm_campaign=OrderDeliveryDateLite). It helps you to **improve your customer service** by delivering the orders on the customer's specified date.

The plugin allows your customers to choose a delivery date on the checkout page. This reduces **cart abandonment by 50%**.

><strong>A perfect plugin</strong>, says what it does and adds the functions simply with no fuss. I even had additional support when I wanted to tweak the plugin to fit my site better. Would recommend this to everyone.

### Here is what some of our customers say about this plugin:

>The <strong>plugin worked as described</strong> and is extremely <strong>well supported</strong> which is key. It works by ordering the order screen by default – latest orders first – or by the delivery date. All one has to do is use a simple checkbox to flick between their preferred method. The plugin developer has responded to a request I had inside a few hours and resolved it very professionally. 5 stars for the plugin and its support.
